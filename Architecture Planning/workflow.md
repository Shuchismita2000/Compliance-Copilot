## 1. Parse the PDF with Structure Awareness

Use a parser that can extract not just raw text, but also **sections, headings, tables, and lists**. Tools like `unstructured`, `LayoutPDFReader` (Sherpa), or LlamaIndex’s PDF reader are designed for this.

## 2. Hierarchical/Structural Chunking

- **Chunk by element type**: Identify and chunk by structural elements (sections, subsections, tables, lists) instead of just paragraphs or fixed sizes.
    
- **Preserve hierarchy**: Attach parent section/subsection info as metadata for each chunk.
    

**Benefits:**

- Retains legal/financial context.
    
- Enables precise citation and retrieval for complex queries

## 3. Metadata Enrichment

For each chunk, attach:

- Source file name
    
- Page numbers
    
- Section/subsection titles (e.g., “Chapter IV: Client Agreement Requirements”)
    
- Chunk index
    
- Element type (paragraph, table, list, etc.)

## 4. (Optional) Dynamic Chunk Sizing

- Use algorithms to adjust chunk size based on content density, section length, or query needs.
    
- For example, longer sections can be split, but small subsections can be merged to avoid tiny, contextless chunks.
    


## 5. Generate Embeddings for Each Chunk

- Use an embedding model to convert each text chunk into a vector representation.
    
- Recommended models:
    
    - **OpenAI text-embedding-3-small** (high quality, easy API)
        
    - **HuggingFace BGE** (open-source alternative)
        
- Pass the chunk text (with or without metadata) to the embedding API.
    

## 6. Store Embeddings in Vector Database

- Choose a vector DB for similarity search:
    
    - **FAISS** (local, fast, customizable)
        
    - **ChromaDB** (easy setup, good LangChain integration)
        
- Store each embedding along with its chunk metadata.
    
- This enables retrieval of relevant chunks based on semantic similarity to user queries.

## 7. Build Retrieval Interface

- Implement a **retriever** that takes user queries, generates query embeddings, and fetches top-k relevant chunks from the vector DB.
    
- The retriever returns chunks with metadata for grounding and citations.


## 8. Integrate with LLM for Answer Generation

- Use an LLM (e.g., GPT-3.5 or GPT-4) to generate natural language answers.
    
- Provide the retrieved chunks as context (prompt augmentation).
    
- Use prompt templates that instruct the model to:
    
    - Answer based on the retrieved regulatory text
        
    - Include citations (document name, page number)
        
    - Explain jargon if requested
        


## 9. Build the Agent & Tool Orchestration Layer

- Use **LangChain ReAct Agent** or similar to orchestrate:
    
    - SearchDocsTool (vector search)
        
    - SummarizeTool (condense long text)
        
    - ExplainTool (jargon simplification)
        
    - CitationTool (return exact clause + source info)
        
- This enables multi-step reasoning and tool usage in response to user queries.
    


## 10. Develop Frontend & API Layer

- Build an interactive frontend (Streamlit recommended for POC).
    
- Connect frontend to backend API (FastAPI or directly to LangChain agent).
    
- Features to include:
    
    - Natural language query input
        
    - Display of answers with citations and summaries
        
    - Option to request jargon explanations
        
    - Viewing source document snippets
        


## 11. Implement Update & Monitoring Pipelines

- Automate ingestion of new regulatory PDFs and amendments.
    
- Re-run parsing, chunking, embedding, and indexing pipelines incrementally.
    
- Monitor query logs and model outputs for quality and compliance.
    
- Use tools like LangSmith for monitoring and logging.
