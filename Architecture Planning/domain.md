### Why is Compliance Complex and Challenging?

1. **Volume & Complexity of Regulations**  
    Regulatory documents are usually long, written in complex legal language, and cover many detailed scenarios.  
    Example: RBI’s guidelines on banking operations or SEBI’s norms for securities trading.
    
2. **Frequent Updates**  
    Regulations evolve rapidly as governments respond to market changes, risks, or new technologies.
    
3. **High Stakes**  
    Non-compliance can lead to:
    
    - Severe fines and penalties
        
    - Legal consequences
        
    - Loss of reputation
        
    - Operational disruptions
        
4. **Manual Efforts are Inefficient**  
    Compliance teams often sift through massive documents manually or rely on traditional keyword searches, which are:
    
    - Time-consuming
        
    - Prone to missing critical information
        
    - Hard to adapt for nuanced queries
