# Data Resources and Ingestion Strategy for Compliance-Copilot POC

This report outlines a comprehensive data acquisition and ingestion strategy for the Compliance-Copilot GenAI assistant POC. The solution requires reliable access to regulatory documents from RBI, SEBI, and FATF, with an efficient pipeline for processing, indexing, and keeping information current.

## Official Data Sources and Availability

## Regulatory Document Repositories

The primary sources for regulatory documents are the official websites of financial regulators:

1. **Reserve Bank of India (RBI)**: Official notifications, circulars, and directives are available as PDF documents on the RBI website. These documents are structured but often lengthy, containing detailed regulations for financial institutions including NBFCs and other entities[1](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/MD44NSIND2E910DD1FBBB471D8CB2E6F4F424F8FF.PDF).
    
2. **Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)**: SEBI provides regulations, circulars, and orders on their official website. Their regulations are regularly updated, with the most recent update to the Portfolio Managers Regulations occurring in February 2025[3](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=1&ssid=3&smid=0).
    
3. **Financial Action Task Force (FATF)**: FATF recommendations and guidelines are available as comprehensive PDF documents from their official website. These include international standards on combating money laundering and terrorist financing that have been endorsed by over 180 countries[4](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/recommendations/FATF%20Recommendations%202012.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf).
    

## Document Format Considerations

Most regulatory documents are available as PDFs, which presents both challenges and opportunities:

- PDFs contain rich information but require specialized processing
    
- Text extraction needs to preserve document structure
    
- Metadata (such as dates, categories, and reference numbers) should be captured
    
- Documents vary in formatting and structure across different regulatory bodies
    

## Data Acquisition Methods

## Direct Downloads vs Automated Collection

For the POC, several approaches can be utilized to acquire the necessary regulatory documents:

1. **Manual Downloads**: Initially, manually downloading key regulatory documents from official websites provides a controlled starting dataset.
    
2. **RBI Push System**: RBI offers an automated notification system called "RBI Push" that monitors for new notifications and automatically downloads them to a user's machine[5](https://www.rbi.org.in/rbipush/notification.html). This tool:
    
    - Continuously monitors the RBI notifications section
        
    - Alerts users when new notifications are released
        
    - Automatically downloads new notifications
        
    - Allows customization of download intervals and file formats
        
3. **RSS Feeds**: Both SEBI and RBI provide RSS feeds for their latest publications:
    
    - SEBI's RSS feed includes Press Releases, Circulars, and Orders/Rulings[6](https://www.sebi.gov.in/rss.html)
        
    - RBI also offers an RSS feed for notifications[8](https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/rss.aspx)
        
    - These feeds can be programmatically monitored to identify and download new documents
        

## When Web Scraping May Be Necessary

While official download methods are preferable, targeted web scraping might be necessary in specific scenarios:

1. **Historical documents** not readily available through direct downloads
    
2. **Supplementary resources** such as interpretative guidelines or FAQs
    
3. **Related content** from authorized industry bodies
    

When implementing web scraping:

- Ensure compliance with robots.txt and website terms of service
    
- Implement rate limiting to avoid overloading servers
    
- Focus only on publicly available regulatory content
    
- Consider legal and ethical implications of data collection
    

## Document Processing Pipeline

## PDF Processing Technologies

Two primary libraries emerge as candidates for processing regulatory PDFs:

1. **PyMuPDF**: Provides detailed metadata extraction and efficient text processing capabilities for PDFs[9](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/).
    
2. **PDFPlumberLoader**: Returns one document per page with detailed metadata about the PDF structure[10](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/pdfplumber/).
    

The processing pipeline should include:

- Text extraction while preserving structural elements
    
- Metadata capture (source, date, regulation number, etc.)
    
- Handling of tables, charts, and other non-text elements
    
- Pre-processing to clean and normalize text
    

## Chunking Strategy for RAG

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach requires effective document chunking:

1. **Semantic Chunking**: Divide documents based on logical sections rather than arbitrary character counts
    
2. **Overlap Strategy**: Include overlap between chunks to maintain context
    
3. **Hierarchical Structure**: Preserve document hierarchy (sections, subsections)
    
4. **Metadata Enrichment**: Attach source information to each chunk for accurate citation
    

## Vector Database Implementation

For the POC, two vector database options stand out:

1. **FAISS**: Efficient for local deployment with strong performance characteristics
    
2. **ChromaDB**: Easy setup with good integration with LangChain
    

The vectorization process should:

- Use appropriate embedding models (OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small or BGE)
    
- Include metadata for filtering and citation
    
- Enable efficient similarity search
    

## Maintaining Current Regulatory Information

## Automated Update Mechanisms

To keep the knowledge base current:

1. **RSS Monitoring**: Implement automated monitoring of SEBI and RBI RSS feeds[6](https://www.sebi.gov.in/rss.html)[8](https://m.rbi.org.in/Scripts/rss.aspx)
    
2. **RBI Push Integration**: Utilize the RBI Push system for automatic notification downloads[5](https://www.rbi.org.in/rbipush/notification.html)
    
3. **Scheduled Crawling**: Set up periodic checks of official websites for new publications
    
4. **Incremental Updates**: Process only new documents rather than rebuilding the entire database
    

## Version Control for Regulations

Regulations evolve over time, requiring:

- Tracking of document versions
    
- Marking superseded regulations
    
- Maintaining historical context
    
- Date-based filtering capabilities
    

## Implementation Recommendations for POC

## Phased Approach to Data Collection

For an effective POC:

1. **Start with Core Documents**: Begin with fundamental regulations from each body:
    
    - RBI: Non-Banking Financial Company Directions[1](https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/notification/PDFs/MD44NSIND2E910DD1FBBB471D8CB2E6F4F424F8FF.PDF)
        
    - SEBI: Portfolio Managers Regulations[3](https://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/home/HomeAction.do?doListing=yes&sid=1&ssid=3&smid=0)
        
    - FATF: Recommendations on combating money laundering[4](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/recommendations/FATF%20Recommendations%202012.pdf.coredownload.inline.pdf)
        
2. **Prioritize Recent Publications**: Focus on regulations updated in the last 1-2 years
    
3. **Limit Initial Scope**: Target specific regulatory domains (e.g., digital lending, KYC, risk management)
    

## Technical Implementation Steps

1. **Document Collection**:
    
    - Set up a structured repository for downloaded documents

    - Create a metadata schema for document categorization
        
2. **Processing Pipeline**:
    
    - Implement PDF processing using PyMuPDF or PDFPlumber[9](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/document_loader_pdf/)[10](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/document_loaders/pdfplumber/)
        
    - Create a chunking strategy that preserves document structure
        
    - Extract and standardize citations and references
        
3. **Vector Database Setup**:
    
    - Configure embedding model integration
        
    - Implement efficient document retrieval
        
    - Set up metadata filtering
        
4. **Update Mechanism**:
    
    - Implement basic monitoring of new publications
        
    - Create processes for incorporating updates
